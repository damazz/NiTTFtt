Computational files for the paper "Thermally and Aerobically Robust Conductivity in an Intrinsically Glassy Metallic Coordination Polymer," by Jiaze Xie, Simon Ewing, Jan-Niklas Boyn, Baorui Cheng, Alexander S. Filatov, Tengzhou Ma, Norman Zhao, Ram Itani, Xiaotong Sun, Himchan Cho, Shrayesh Patel, Dmitri V. Talapin, Jiwoong Park, David A. Mazziotti, and John S. Anderson.  Molecules are treated with the variational two-electron reduced density matrix (v2RDM) theory in the Quantum Chemistry add-on package in Maple as well as density functional theory (DFT) in Gaussian.  Periodic moelecular systems are treated with density functional theory (DFT) in the Quantum Espresso package.
